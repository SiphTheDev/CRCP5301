 This shall be a catch-all for the various aspects of my Creative Coding Capstone Project
***
## Preparation & Inspiration: 

### I - Brainstorming & Idea Development

### III - ProjectProposal
Bringing the Project into focus and putting together a timeline
- Learning p5.js
- Gantt Chart
- Project Proposal and sketch

### IV - Experimenting With P5.js
Sample projects as I familiarize myself with p5.js and its differences from processing
- Pong_Recreation
- PreLoadTesting

### V - Prototyping Elements
Individual sketches to work out code challenges independently of the full project - the apparent redundance between these is the result of several false starts testing different libraries. 
- Enemy & Grid Test
- Grid Test Two
- Image and Animation Test
- Tile Mapping Test

### VI - Project Ascent
The home of the actual game files
- Project Ascent
