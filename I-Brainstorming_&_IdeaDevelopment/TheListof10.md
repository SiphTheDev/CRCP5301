## The List of 10:
***
1. A way to randomly generate MC-Escher and/or Fractal-based Medieval structures that shift and change with user interaction.  
2. A program that can take in Arthurian tales and then create new stories in middle-English where the knights actually act in character.  
3. A tower-defence game with enemy attacks and helpful resources based on music you put into it. 
4. A program to generate alien landscapes with adjustable settings for color, types of structures in the scene, etc. 
5. A tool to manage art ideas. Put in random thoughts of inspiration, and come back to it when you want to do something but you're drawing a blank on ideas.
6. An RPG dungeon maker that doesn't just stick rooms together, but creates a through-line plot for the dungeon that influences the room's designs and contents. 
7. A program that simulates medieval structures complete with fictional histories based on elements put in by the user (ex: priority to trade, mainly a religious center, etc) and the local resources and environment (marble, coastline, etc). Basically, how would a city in XYZ region with XYZ focus develop and how would it look?
8. Attempt to create a map showing the movements of Roman emperors and shifts in other aspects of the empire (borders, rebellions, economic prosperity) over time. 
9. A political alliance simulation. Many different entities which each have own motives and actions that react to each other and adjust alliances/hostilities over time and in response to crises/events. Player could join in. 
10. A museum management game with randomly generated art. Would involve avoiding fakes, deciding whether or not to buy trafficked art, theming goals, budget, etc.
