### Essential SMU Courses (In no particular order)
1. **Mummies to Gladiators** - An art history course that was the first to introduce me to history as a field of analysis and learning about new cultures, rather than simply the mass memorization of dates and figures. Especially sparked an interest in Knossos  and Ancient Mesopotamian cultures. 
2. **Discernment & Discourse 1/Fiction: Stories out of place** - Two courses, but both were hugely influential on refining my writing skills, which were woefully inadequate before SMU. I finally had a flexible framework with which to go forward on future writing assignments. The latter also introduced me to some of my favorite and least favorite books of all time. 
3. **Medieval Pilgrimage** 
4. **All three abroads**
5. **Introduction to 3D modeling**

### Significant Books
1. **Le Morte D'Arthur** - General info, Dinadan, proper writing, joy of real medieval hist along with British hist.
2. **Lord of the Flies** - My undeniably least favorite book, due to its general pessimism towards humanity. I really connected the best with Piggy, not only in the nerdy way, but also in the reliance on modern medical technology (in his case glasses) to survive.
3. **Isaac Asimov's Foundation Novels** - Grew up with stories like I-Robot as nighttime stories, so this was my first independent deep-dive into Sci-Fi. Discuss Psycho-history, Salvor-Hardin's philosophy and the idea of the fall and rise of empires.
4. **Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro** - Really related with the main character, not in the sense of hating their father or being overly tied to a past age, but in the sense of prioritising a job in which one takes pride over social connections and relationships. It was a great warning that helped snap me out of an excessive focus on school work at the expense of really developing deep friendships. Also, I really felt it when he just couldn't keep up with banter, less because he didn't understand it and more because he wasn't comfortable with the expected responses.
5. **Lord of the Rings** - My first fantasy novels, I read them the summer before I went to high school, and they were the moment I shifted away from an obsession with Star Wars and towards a greater focus on fantasy and Medieval Times. 
6. **Dune** - The story itself is a fun adventure in a really unique setting that mixes sci-fi with history in unique ways and the characters are truly great, but the real credit I have to give to Dune is getting me back into reading for fun rather than just for school. It was the first fictional work that I could really dive into in ages, and it's inspired several interesting project ideas which I haven't yet had time to pursue. 
8. **The Phanton Tollbooth**
7. **De Architectura by Vitruvius** -
