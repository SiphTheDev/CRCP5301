# Mapping Lists

Notes: Challenging to find connections beyond very basic material ones (Knossos is cool) or very broad (I like learning stuff). Maybe that's alright.

### Essential SMU Courses (In no particular order)
1. **Mummies to Gladiators** - An art history course that was the first to introduce me to history as a field of analysis and learning about new cultures, rather than simply the mass memorization of dates and figures. Especially sparked an interest in Knossos  and Ancient Mesopotamian cultures. 
2. **Discernment & Discourse 1/Fiction: Stories out of place** - Two courses, but both were hugely influential on refining my writing skills, which were pretty poor before SMU. I finally had a flexible framework with which to go forward on future writing assignments. The latter also introduced me to some of my favorite and least favorite books of all time. 
3. **Weimar** - My first abroad with SMU, it was the only time I really was able to settle in and feel comfortable in another city & culture. Also, the single most daring thing I've done was an independent weekend trip to Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and Rothenburg ob Der Tauber. 
4. **Rome/Paris** - The history was incredible, and actually getting to go into ancient and medieval ruins makes the history so much more real, but this was also the class where I really found my people, as it were. Turns out Paris is a pretty nerdy city if you look in the right places. Probably the most *myself* I've ever been.
5. **Medieval Pilgrimage** - An awesome course in part because of the abroad aspect to Jerusalem and the Sea of Galilee, which were the greatest culture shock I've had, but in a good way. However, we had many excellent speakers, and talking with some of them helped me realized that I didn't actually want a full career in History academia. 
7. **Junior Seminar** - The single most challenging course I've ever taken, and worth note primarily for that challenge. The stress from this class simultaneously dented my self-confidence in my history while pushing me to more creative outlets like Creative Computing and my greatest sewing projects. A horrible experience, but I found a lot of good out of it. 
8. **Internship at DeGolyer Library** - The source of my best research and probably my greatest projects: re-creating a collection of maps on SMU's history, and in the process writing a paper on the history of Clements Hall. Though with more time and editing it would be better, it's doubtless the best paper I've written and the peak of my history career.

#### Significant Books
1. **Le Morte D'Arthur** - A book of Arthurian Tales by Sir Thomas Malory. It's important to me because my interest in it in High School allowed me to meet some scholars at SMU, and it's thus a large part of why I'm here. However, internally it's fun both as a way to see the fantasy medieval folks wrote about the Middle Ages, and comparing the myths' many translations are a good way to practice finding bias in different accounts, which has proven very relevant. However, the best part is my favorite knight, Sir Dinadan, who is basically a normal, reasonable guy in a world of chivalric idealistic knights. He reacts the way I would in those scenarios, and he sort of shows the real people who wrote these tales. (Dinadan's seriously deadpan funny in LMD'A!)

2. **Lord of the Flies** - Without a doubt my least favorite book, but significant to how I came to understand the world. Though cynical, I'm generally optimistic about humanity, an aspect of myself I defined in spite of the horrid pessimism of this book. Of course, my dislike was exacerbated because the only character I even remotely liked was Piggy (due both to his intellectual aspects and his partial disabilities) and [spoilers] he gets murdered right at the end. 

3. **Isaac Asimov's Foundation Novels** - I Grew up with stories like I-Robot as nighttime stories, but this was my first independent deep-dive into Sci-Fi. Back when I had time to read for fun, these explored all sorts of ideas I hadn't thought about before, like whether or not actions are fated, how we determine socially acceptable behavior, and the nature of history as relying both on general trends and individual actions at flash points. Also, Salvor Hardin's philosophy that "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent" resonated with me a lot when I was younger and even more idealistic (basically pre-2016). 

4. **Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro** - I really connected with Mr. Stevens, the protagonist, insofar as he understood banter but wasn't actually able to deliver it, and insofar as he prioritized work and duty over relationships to an unhealthy degree. It was a good wake-up call for me when I first read it, and I still keep it in mind now when I start burying myself in schoolwork.

5. **Lord of the Rings** - My first fantasy novels, I read them the summer before I went to high school, and they were the moment I shifted away from an obsession with Star Wars and towards a greater focus on fantasy and the medieval world. It's a uniquely immersive world, and inspired a lot of my creative ideas at the time. Samwise is the best character, don't @ me. 

6. **Dune** - The story itself is a fun adventure in a really unique setting that mixes sci-fi with history in immersive ways much like the foundation novels and the characters are truly great, but the real credit I have to give to Dune is getting me back into reading for fun rather than just for school. It was the first fictional work that I could really dive into in ages, and it's inspired several interesting project ideas which I haven't yet had time to pursue.

7. **De Architectura by Vitruvius** - More of a technical manual on Roman Architecture with sprinkling's of a retired architect's thoughts than a novel, De Architectura is for me the greatest example of "people have always been people" that there is. He isn't poetic like many surviving historical works, but is instead down to earth and often blunt. Further, the issues he grapples with, such as studying past scholars and wondering what their lives were like and struggling with the fact that networking often works better than skill, are still very real and present today.

### Significant Games (Because I just don't watch enough movies to fill a list)
1. **Lego Star Wars** - My first video game, it was where I learned the ins and outs of basic control schemes and puzzle design. Personally significant because it was the game I played while bedridden for a year. 
2. **Civilization V, then VI** - The first game to really teach me the dangers of having 50 different tasks going at once so that you never reach a stopping point. However, it was also one of my early introductions to certain historical figures and the idea of trying to represent history through games. 
3. **Minecraft** - The game create an atmosphere that is so open that almost anyone can get into it, but still so cohesive that everything still feels like Minecraft. It was also how most of my friends in middle school hung out every day because we lived too far apart to actually meet up, so I have some serious rose tinted glasses when talking about it. 
4. **Dark Souls** - I don't actually care about the challenge (I'm a very casual gamer and I beat it, so it can't be that hard.), but the game's world is not only beautiful, but it does a tremendous amount of subtle and visual storytelling that makes it truly immersive. Further, the sources for its lore in game are also biased and fragmentary, so it's one of the best games to simulate doing historical research that I've seen. 
6. **My Sims** - Nothing like Sims, in MySims you had to go out and gather resources in the environment, and then actually design furniture and art that incorporated them to make the townsfolk happy. In the process, you gained access to new areas and supplies. It scratched the same itch as Minecraft, where you have to gather the materials in order to create your projects which made them feel so much more earned, but much earlier. 
7. **Breath of the Wild** - Excellent immersive world design, though certain areas were a bit too expansive at times & I've never liked the mechanic of enemies leveling up with you, as it undermines the sense of progress. Still, the aesthetics are on point.

### Significant Songs

1. **LaDaDee (Cody Simpson) & Let's Dance to Joy Division (The Wombats)** - boppy, but the real reason is because of where I found them. During my Jr Seminar I was so exhausted and burned out that I stopped feeling emotions for a while, but these songs were the background for some cute animations that helped me snap out of it for a bit, and that association keeps me energized whenever I hear them. I've listened to LDtJD during almost every essay I've written in the last two years. 
2. **Ruins (Lenich & Kirya cover, original by Toby Fox)** - Overwhelmingly tranquil, washes away whatever other stresses I have.
3.  **Zora's Domain Night (Breath of the Wild)** - Also just unabashedly calming.  
4.  **On Top of the World (Imagine Dragons)** - Hopeful, about resilience in the face of challenges.
5. **Together Against the Sisters (JYC Row & PrinceWhateverer)** - Slow but powerful fantasy-ish music (Lord of the Rings-ish), but good to get pumped up for some big undertaking or other. 
6. **Platform (Or4nges) - Energetic, but in a contained way, rather than being overwhelming. It has the memorably clear and catchy melody common of chip-tune music.
**A ton of others** - My music taste changes constantly, even month to month, so this sections varies a lot. I could put dozens of songs here, depending on how far back I go. Approaching Nirvana used to be my favorites, as they had a similar quiet, cinematic feel to Minecraft, but I've drifted away from them a long time ago.

NOT DONE BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!### Sources of Info/Inspiration for past successful projects 

Clements Hall, weirdly
 - strange architecture in general, tbh. I love trying to see every room in a building, and realizing that there are parts of buildings I've been to every day that I've never seen. Makes the world feel still magical and unexplored.

Dreams/about to fall asleep. 

Whatever thing I'm a big fan of at a given time, be it Dune, Undertale, RWBY, Dark Souls, She-Ra, D&D, etc. 

Games I like but want to add to/refine/update. 

Whatever historical period I'm studying at any given moment. In past, it's been: Medieval Manuscripts - Nuremburg Chronical, Arthurian Knights, The Byzantine and Ottoman empires, Assyira, Babylon, Knossos, Rome (in its various forms), Modern Germany, Medieval Paris, etc. 

Bouncing ideas off of friends - D&D strategy

Exploring new techniques and seeing what comes of it - Pathfinding, paper cutting & geometric shapes, heraldry. 

A few key motifs I've picked up and keep coming back too  Medieval, Yetis, Cute Fantasy creatures like dragons & unicorns.

Arthur, a lot.

### What I Like for Peak Productivity

1. **Low ambient sound, but NOT silence** - Being in a silent room not only means I get distracted by such simple sounds as a pencil writing or a page turning, but I also get self conscious about making such sounds myself. Thus, every page I read or word I type is a distraction while I try to do it silently. 
2. **Very Repetitive Music** - one song on loop so I can tun it out while it drowns out everything else. 
2. **Clearly Defined Deadlines** - I just work more efficiently on a deadline than on something more open-ended. Self paced projects are doable, but a struggle.
3. **A Clear and Orderly To-Do List** - without this I will constantly and spontaneously remember stuff I need to do, and I won't be able to focus until whatever I just remembered gets done. It's terribly inefficient.
4. **Some Level of Interest in the Topic** - I try to give my all to every class and project, even if it's just for general curriculum credit, but it's much easier to study for an exam when I care about what's on it. The worst option is when I disagree with what's being taught, but have to memorize it anyway. 
5. **The Option of Solitude** - I can study with folks around (though never really in a study group except to review old info for exams), but I work best when I can really bite the bullet and focus on the task at hand. Group projects are fine as long as the group actually meets and plans things out. 
6. **Rain/Fog/CoolWeather** - I love to study when the world is quiet and cozy, and heat makes me lethargic. When it rains, I try to study outside if I can, though my paper notebooks don't always appreciate it.

### Artists that Inspire You
1. **Waterflame - Musician** - Works in a huge variety of genres and does all the album art along with the music. The ability to keep exploring new genres, styles, and even media is awesome, and you never know what their next song will be. 
2. **Studio Ghibli - Animation Studio** - Do I even need to explain why? The detail in their animations is absolutely gorgeous, and their stories are challenging but hopeful. 
3. **Cube Watermelon - Webcomic Artist** - Creator of "Kiwi Blitz" and "Sleepless Domain," Cube has a very distinct and cute art style which I love! Further, she's managed to maintain two different comics while also teaching abroad for a while, which is an impressive work ethic. 
4. **Brianne Drouhard - Webcomic Artist** - Creator of "Harpy Gee," Drouhard has also done lots of character designs and several animations. I really enjoy the comic, but I also am impressed with the consistent uploads. 
5. **Bob Ross - Painter** - Not just for his optimism and encouragement, but because watching him paint helped me let go of my desire to control every last line and detail of my art, and to instead allow the medium to work for me. 
6. **Walter Gropius - Architect** - I don't love all of his designs, but I admire his dedication to the Bauhaus philosophy and effort to actually bring about a new era of functional but still beautiful art and architecture. 
7. **Vitruvius - Architect** - He set out to lay out all of his experience and research in a manual to advise future architects and people who planned to commission buildings, something which had not been done for architecture in Rome up to that point. Not only did he preserve the art in his own time and for the enlightenment, he inspired a slew of other technical manuals across many fields.

### Visual Art Pieces 
1. **Griffons at the Palace of Knossos** - The historical significance is one thing, but they have very smooth rounded geometric designs which are just satisfying to look at. I love how bold their red-blue-yellow color schemes are! Muted colors are wonderful, but I especially love when colors really pop!
2. **Wanda Koop - Satelite Cities & Dreamline** - Koop uses bold colors and simple but flowing shapes to create fantastical landscapes. The feel calming to me, as though viewed from a distance on a foggy day. 
3. **Fort Worth Water Gardens** - Modern, chunky shapes, but with a calm, natural element that makes them cozy rather than harsh.
4. **Nuremburg Chronical** - An extensive work printed in the 1400s, it attempts to have woodcuts of all the significant world cities and those in the area. The woodcuts are absolutely stunning. 
5. **The Ishtar Gate** - Combines my love of bold colors and shapes with historical significance. Images don't do it's grand scale justice. 
6. The Reichstag - The German equivalent to the US Capitol building, the Reichstag is a mix of historical and modern architectural styles, having housed 5 different German governments in its history, each with vastly different ideologies. 
7. **Joseph & the Technicolor Dreamcoat** - A fun musical with a great variety of styles mixed in. 
8. **Mon San Michel** - On of the most fantastical, fairy-tale like places that exists on earth. This is a small monastery on an island that has built up into a fortress and a small town over the centuries. It has just an incredible verticality, with each layer showing different historical styles and ideals. I love the way it just seems to cascade down the mountain, blending into it in some places. 

### Major Life Experiences
1. **Cancer** - Far and away the most life-defining of my experiences, I was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma at the age of 8. I was in a wheelchair for well over a year, and still have some side effects today. Fortunately, I had a very supportive community, so I was able to stay optimistic through it all. I ended up forming a lot of my identity around that optimism. Despite that, I hated how little control I had over some things, so I became a serious planner. I like to do everything I can to make sure things go smoothly and according to plan, rather than winging it. 
2. **Eagle Scout** - I was in the Boy Scouts for many years through getting my Eagle rank, and I volunteered to help out while my little brother was going through it. The experience in leadership and public speaking was super helpful, though I've gotten a bit rusty. It did give me a lot of practice working with kids, which helped prepare me for my current job as a teaching assistant at a local children's museum. 
3. **Abroad to Germany in High School**
4. **Starting High School** - I don't know exactly what it was, because it started even the summer before, but it seems most of my long term hobbies and interests really kicked off in that first semester. I met a lot of friends I still have, picked up several hobbies as well as my interest in the medieval world, and somehow spontaneously went from being quite messy to being super organized. 
4. **First Semester at SMU** - I was fully prepared for the academics of college, but I had lived in a little bubble for most of the social stuff, and my first semester was a ... lets go with traumatic ... experience. I had no interest in alcohol, and assumed most other folks shared that view, but the real challenge was that my first semester was in 2016 during the election, which meant that everyone was talking about politics, and it really shaped a lot of the social organizations at the time. I was forced to actually define what my own views were while still learning how little I knew about the injustices of the world. The celebrations/mourning the day after the election shook campus and myself. 
5. **Hardest Semester at SMU** - The semester of my Junior History Seminar may have been the hardest in my college experience, and it changed me. I found my limits and the stress sort of broke the optimism that I'd defined myself around. I didn't feel emotions for several months other than apathy and was in a constant state of frantic stress. However, the chaos forced me to find new refuges, especially new art media, in order to cope. After that semester I shifted to put more priority on spending time with people rather than books, and I made more time for creative pursuits. 

### Media
1. **Vinyl Stickers/Paper** - Early on, I started down the path of arts/crafts by scrapbooking with my mom, and one of the first media I ever really experimented with was cutting paper and/or vinyl stickers by hand. This shaped my love of bold colors and flat shapes in my art. 
2. **Fleece-Flannel-Crushed Velvet** - I got into hand-stitching as a way to relax during my stressful Junior Year at SMU, as the rhythmic, repetitive motion was relaxing, and the end result was something soft and snuggly. I mostly make plush toys, but occasionally I also do bags or other more practical projects. 
3. **3D Modeling & Printing** - This is sort of the culmination of my quest at the very start of my art journey. I was always seeking a way not only to render my ideas, but to render them in 3D. This progressed through leatherwork and attempts at chainmail, to wood-working, then the layered vinyl stickers, sewing, and finally 3D printing. However, along the way I've come to appreciate all the different media for their unique benefits. 
4. **Sketching** - My weakest area by far, but I've been working at it and getting better over the summer. I still love architecture in sharp perspective, but I'm getting better at more natural and organic shapes and shading now. 
5. **Calligraphy** - I was attracted to calligraphy early on because it had objective standards and I liked those as a way to easily track my progress as I improved. Though I mostly use it for envelopes and such, my appreciation for its flexibility has grown. 
6. **Unusual media** - Including: baking, pearler beads, carving stamps, basic leather working, and to some extent buildings in Minecraft. I haven't done a ton with any of these, but they have all been interesting forays and experiments.
