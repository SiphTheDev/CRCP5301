# Mapping Lists

Notes: Challenging to find connections beyond very basic material ones (Knossos is cool) or very broad (I like learning stuff). Maybe that's alright.

### Essential SMU Courses (In no particular order)
1. **Mummies to Gladiators** - An art history course that was the first to introduce me to history as a field of analysis and learning about new cultures, rather than simply the mass memorization of dates and figures. Especially sparked an interest in Knossos  and Ancient Mesopotamian cultures. 
2. **Discernment & Discourse 1/Fiction: Stories out of place** - Two courses, but both were hugely influential on refining my writing skills, which were pretty poor before SMU. I finally had a flexible framework with which to go forward on future writing assignments. The latter also introduced me to some of my favorite and least favorite books of all time. 
3. **Weimar** - My first abroad with SMU, it was the only time I really was able to settle in and feel comfortable in another city & culture. Also, the single most daring thing I've done was an independent weekend trip to Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and Rothenburg ob Der Tauber. 
4. **Rome/Paris** - The history was incredible, and actually getting to go into ancient and medieval ruins makes the history so much more real, but this was also the class where I really found my people, as it were. Turns out Paris is a pretty nerdy city if you look in the right places. Probably the most *myself* I've ever been.
5. **Medieval Pilgrimage** - An awesome course in part because of the abroad aspect to Jerusalem and the Sea of Galilee, which were the greatest culture shock I've had, but in a good way. However, we had many excellent speakers, and talking with some of them helped me realized that I didn't actually want a full career in History academia. 
7. **Junior Seminar** - The single most challenging course I've ever taken, and worth note primarily for that challenge. The stress from this class simultaneously dented my self-confidence in my history while pushing me to more creative outlets like Creative Computing and my greatest sewing projects. A horrible experience, but I found a lot of good out of it. 
8. **Internship at DeGolyer Library** - The source of my best research and probably my greatest projects: re-creating a collection of maps on SMU's history, and in the process writing a paper on the history of Clements Hall. Though with more time and editing it would be better, it's doubtless the best paper I've written and the peak of my history career.

### Significant Books
1. **Le Morte D'Arthur** - General info, Dinadan, proper writing, joy of real medieval hist along with British hist.
2. **Lord of the Flies** - My undeniably least favorite book, due to its general pessimism towards humanity. I really connected the best with Piggy, not only in the nerdy way, but also in the reliance on modern medical technology (in his case glasses) to survive.
3. **Isaac Asimov's Foundation Novels** - Grew up with stories like I-Robot as nighttime stories, so this was my first independent deep-dive into Sci-Fi. Discuss Psycho-history, Salvor-Hardin's philosophy and the idea of the fall and rise of empires.
4. **Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro** - Really related with the main character, not in the sense of hating their father or being overly tied to a past age, but in the sense of prioritising a job in which one takes pride over social connections and relationships. It was a great warning that helped snap me out of an excessive focus on school work at the expense of really developing deep friendships. Also, I really felt it when he just couldn't keep up with banter, less because he didn't understand it and more because he wasn't comfortable with the expected responses.
5. **Lord of the Rings** - My first fantasy novels, I read them the summer before I went to high school, and they were the moment I shifted away from an obsession with Star Wars and towards a greater focus on fantasy and Medieval Times. 
6. **Dune** - The story itself is a fun adventure in a really unique setting that mixes sci-fi with history in unique ways and the characters are truly great, but the real credit I have to give to Dune is getting me back into reading for fun rather than just for school. It was the first fictional work that I could really dive into in ages, and it's inspired several interesting project ideas which I haven't yet had time to pursue. 
8. **The Phanton Tollbooth**
7. **De Architectura by Vitruvius** -

### What I Like for Peak Productivity
1. Low Sound, but NOT silence - Some background noise helps cover individual distracting sounds and a sense of feeling spookily alone. However, Dead silence makes me super self-conscious. Suddently I fear I'm distracting others and myself with the sound of turning a page and thus I distract myself constantly. 
2. Clearly Defined Deadlines - I just work more efficiently on a deadline that on something more open-ended. Self paced projects are doable, but a struggle.
3. A Clear and Orderly To-Do List
4. Some level of engagement, or at least not outright resentment, towards the topic at hand. - I try to give my best effort to every class, even if they're just for credit or not necessarily my favorite subjects, but I've had at least one class where I vehemently disagreed with much of the content, and it made studying for the courses rather more difficult.

### Artists that Inspire You
1. **Waterflame - Musician** - 
2. **Studio Ghibli - Animation Studio+** - 
3. **Cube Watermelon - Webcomic Artist** - Creator of "Kiwi Blitz" and "Sleepless Domain"
4. **Brianne Drouhard - Webcomic Artist** - Creator of "Harpy Gee"
5. **Bob Ross - Painter** - Not just for his optimism and encourangement, but because watching him paint helped me let go of my desire to control every last line and detail of my art, and to instead allow the medium to work for me.
