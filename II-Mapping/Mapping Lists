# Mapping Lists

Notes: Challenging to find connections beyond very basic material ones (Knossos is cool) or very broad (I like learning stuff). Maybe that's alright.

### Essential SMU Courses (In no particular order)
1. **Mummies to Gladiators** - An art history course that was the first to introduce me to history as a field of analysis and learning about new cultures, rather than simply the mass memorization of dates and figures. Especially sparked an interest in Knossos  and Ancient Mesopotamian cultures. 
2. **Discernment & Discourse 1/Fiction: Stories out of place** - Two courses, but both were hugely influential on refining my writing skills, which were pretty poor before SMU. I finally had a flexible framework with which to go forward on future writing assignments. The latter also introduced me to some of my favorite and least favorite books of all time. 
3. **Weimar** - My first abroad with SMU, it was the only time I really was able to settle in and feel comfortable in another city & culture. Also, the single most daring thing I've done was an independent weekend trip to Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and Rothenburg ob Der Tauber. 
4. **Rome/Paris** - The history was incredible, and actually getting to go into ancient and medieval ruins makes the history so much more real, but this was also the class where I really found my people, as it were. Turns out Paris is a pretty nerdy city if you look in the right places. Probably the most *myself* I've ever been.
5. **Medieval Pilgrimage** - An awesome course in part because of the abroad aspect to Jerusalem and the Sea of Galilee, which were the greatest culture shock I've had, but in a good way. However, we had many excellent speakers, and talking with some of them helped me realized that I didn't actually want a full career in History academia. 
7. **Junior Seminar** - The single most challenging course I've ever taken, and worth note primarily for that challenge. The stress from this class simultaneously dented my self-confidence in my history while pushing me to more creative outlets like Creative Computing and my greatest sewing projects. A horrible experience, but I found a lot of good out of it. 
8. **Internship at DeGolyer Library** - The source of my best research and probably my greatest projects: re-creating a collection of maps on SMU's history, and in the process writing a paper on the history of Clements Hall. Though with more time and editing it would be better, it's doubtless the best paper I've written and the peak of my history career.

#### Significant Books
1. **Le Morte D'Arthur** - A book of Arthurian Tales by Sir Thomas Malory. It's important to me because my interest in it in High School allowed me to meet some scholars at SMU, and it's thus a large part of why I'm here. However, internally it's fun both as a way to see the fantasy medieval folks wrote about the Middle Ages, and comparing the myths' many translations are a good way to practice finding bias in different accounts, which has proven very relevant. However, the best part is my favorite knight, Sir Dinadan, who is basically a normal, reasonable guy in a world of chivalric idealistic knights. He reacts the way I would in those scenarios, and he sort of shows the real people who wrote these tales. (Dinadan's seriously deadpan funny in LMD'A!)

2. **Lord of the Flies** - Without a doubt my least favorite book, but significant to how I came to understand the world. Though cynical, I'm generally optimistic about humanity, an aspect of myself I defined in spite of the horrid pessimism of this book. Of course, my dislike was exacerbated because the only character I even remotely liked was Piggy (due both to his intellectual aspects and his partial disabilities) and [spoilers] he gets murdered right at the end. 

3. **Isaac Asimov's Foundation Novels** - I Grew up with stories like I-Robot as nighttime stories, but this was my first independent deep-dive into Sci-Fi. Back when I had time to read for fun, these explored all sorts of ideas I hadn't thought about before, like whether or not actions are fated, how we determine socially acceptable behavior, and the nature of history as relying both on general trends and individual actions at flash points. Also, Salvor Hardin's philosophy that "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent" resonated with me a lot when I was younger and even more idealistic (basically pre-2016). 

4. **Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro** - I really connected with Mr. Stevens, the protagonist, insofar as he understood banter but wasn't actually able to deliver it, and insofar as he prioritized work and duty over relationships to an unhealthy degree. It was a good wake-up call for me when I first read it, and I still keep it in mind now when I start burying myself in schoolwork.

5. **Lord of the Rings** - My first fantasy novels, I read them the summer before I went to high school, and they were the moment I shifted away from an obsession with Star Wars and towards a greater focus on fantasy and the medieval world. It's a uniquely immersive world, and inspired a lot of my creative ideas at the time. Samwise is the best character, don't @ me. 

6. **Dune** - The story itself is a fun adventure in a really unique setting that mixes sci-fi with history in immersive ways much like the foundation novels and the characters are truly great, but the real credit I have to give to Dune is getting me back into reading for fun rather than just for school. It was the first fictional work that I could really dive into in ages, and it's inspired several interesting project ideas which I haven't yet had time to pursue.

7. **De Architectura by Vitruvius** - More of a technical manual on Roman Architecture with sprinkling's of a retired architect's thoughts than a novel, De Architectura is for me the greatest example of "people have always been people" that there is. He isn't poetic like many surviving historical works, but is instead down to earth and often blunt. Further, the issues he grapples with, such as studying past scholars and wondering what their lives were like and struggling with the fact that networking often works better than skill, are still very real and present today.

### Significant Games (Because I just don't watch enough movies to fill a list)
1. **Lego Star Wars** - My first video game, it was where I learned the ins and outs of basic control schemes and puzzle design. Personally significant because it was the game I played while bedridden for a year. 
2. **Civilization V, then VI** - The first game to really teach me the dangers of having 50 different tasks going at once so that you never reach a stopping point. However, it was also one of my early introductions to certain historical figures and the idea of trying to represent history through games. 
3. **Minecraft** - The game create an atmosphere that is so open that almost anyone can get into it, but still so cohesive that everything still feels like Minecraft. It was also how most of my friends in middle school hung out every day because we lived too far apart to actually meet up, so I have some serious rose tinted glasses when talking about it. 
4. **Dark Souls** - I don't actually care about the challenge (I'm a very casual gamer and I beat it, so it can't be that hard.), but the game's world is not only beautiful, but it does a tremendous amount of subtle and visual storytelling that makes it truly immersive. Further, the sources for its lore in game are also biased and fragmentary, so it's one of the best games to simulate doing historical research that I've seen. 
6. **My Sims** - Nothing like Sims, in MySims you had to go out and gather resources in the environment, and then actually design furniture and art that incorporated them to make the townsfolk happy. In the process, you gained access to new areas and supplies. It scratched the same itch as Minecraft, where you have to gather the materials in order to create your projects which made them feel so much more earned, but much earlier.

### What I Like for Peak Productivity
1. Low Sound, but NOT silence - Some background noise helps cover individual distracting sounds and a sense of feeling spookily alone. However, Dead silence makes me super self-conscious. Suddently I fear I'm distracting others and myself with the sound of turning a page and thus I distract myself constantly. 
2. Clearly Defined Deadlines - I just work more efficiently on a deadline that on something more open-ended. Self paced projects are doable, but a struggle.
3. A Clear and Orderly To-Do List
4. Some level of engagement, or at least not outright resentment, towards the topic at hand. - I try to give my best effort to every class, even if they're just for credit or not necessarily my favorite subjects, but I've had at least one class where I vehemently disagreed with much of the content, and it made studying for the courses rather more difficult.
