### Essential SMU Courses (In no particular order)
1. **Mummies to Gladiators** - An art history course that was the first to introduce me to history as a field of analysis and learning about new cultures, rather than simply the mass memorization of dates and figures. Especially sparked an interest in Knossos  and Ancient Mesopotamian cultures. 
2. **Discernment & Discourse 1/Fiction: Stories out of place** - Two courses, but both were hugely influential on refining my writing skills, which were woefully inadequate before SMU. I finally had a flexible framework with which to go forward on future writing assignments. The latter also introduced me to some of my favorite and least favorite books of all time. 
3. **Medieval Pilgrimage** 
4. **All three abroads**
5. **Introduction to 3D modeling**
